# NgrxCart

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.2.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## NGRX Advantages
NgRx is most useful when:
1. You have shared state across many components (e.g., cart, auth, notifications).
2. Your app is large-scale with complex flows.
3. You want debuggable, predictable, testable state management.
4. Single Source of Truth (Global State)
5. Predictable State Changes
6. Time-Travel Debugging : NgRx DevTools lets you rewind, replay, or inspect every action/state change.
7. Scalability for Large Applications
8. Improved Performance with Memoized Selectors : NgRx Selectors are memoized â†’ components only re-render when relevant state changes. Prevents unnecessary Angular    change detection cycles.
